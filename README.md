# Smallest-Subset-That-Sums-To-Target
smallestsubsetsumtok.c finds a minimally sized example subset of a set of positive integers that has element sum of some target integer, if one exists.

smallestsubsetsumtok_lomem.c does the same but requires less RAM on big projects.

largestsubsetsumtok.c does similar to smallestsubsetsumtok.c but finds largest subset.

largestsubsetsumtok2.c does similar to largestsubsetsumtok.c but requires less RAM and is limited to smaller subset sizes.
